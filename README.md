![Game Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Typing+Defense+-+PatchFest+2025)

## The Vision
**Word Blast** is a fast-paced browser game where your keyboard is your weapon. Words fall from the sky like missiles, and you must type them out to destroy them before they breach your defenses.


**The Goal:** Survive as long as possible, rack up a high score, and improve your typing speed!

## Tech Stack
*   **Core:** HTML5 Canvas (Rendering)
*   **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Styling:** CSS3 (Cyberpunk/Hacker theme)
*   **No Frameworks:** Pure, dependency-free code for easy learning.

## Project Structure
*   `index.html`: The main entry point containing the game canvas and UI overlay.
*   `script.js`: The game engine. Contains the game loop, enemy logic, and input handling.
*   `style.css`: Visual styling for the UI, scoreboards, and game container.
*   `ISSUES.md`: A list of suggested features and bugs for PatchFest participants.

## How to Play
1.  **Start the Game:** Open `index.html` in your browser.
2.  **Type to Shoot:** Look at the falling words. Type the letters on your keyboard to destroy them.
3.  **Don't Miss:** If a word hits the bottom of the screen, it's **GAME OVER**.
